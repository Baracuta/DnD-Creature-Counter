# DnD-Creature-Counter

## Overview
A tool I can use to track multiple creatures at a glance when playing Dungeons and Dragons.

## Description
The idea is this: a tool which I can use and access as a webpage that gives me multiple input criteria. Things like attacks, the damage of the attack, various modifiers, all that stuff that is necessary to track for certain monsters, with the ability to track multiple of each critter I add. That way, I can easily track multiple creatures at once. Their hit-point values, Armour Class, etc. I'd be able to roll dice for them.

Design Principles/Function that form should follow

1. It should make tracking the status of many monsters easier and more convenient
2. It should be a supplement to other programs which let me track stat blocks, not a replacement
3. It should be easy to glance at, and be beautiful

Things I want to be able to do:
    1. Track Multiple Creatures
        For each creature:
            1. Hitpoints
                - Healthbars/Damage Bars/Options for both!
                - Add/subtract features
            2. Armour Class
            3. Any applied buffs/debuffs/concentration
    2. Add/remove creatures quickly
        - Duplicate an existing creature
        - Create trackers for new creatures, quickly
    3. Track conditions/buffs/debuffs applied to individual creatures
    4. Drag/Drop creature blocks to re-arrange them as I need

## Motivation
I love playing D&D, both as an Adventurer and as the Dungeon Master. When I'm DMing, I find there are many tools that let me see the abilities and stats of creatures in combat, but none that actually let me record any effects or spells placed upon them. Moreso, there are none that conveniently let me track how much damage many different creatures have sustained during combat. As such, I have decided to undertake creating this myself!

## Visual Aid
    
1.When you boot up the creature counter, you'll be faced with 12 slots.

2.Clicking the "Add" button will add a blank creature slate in the first available slot. The DamageTaken, Creature Name, and Max HP option can all be edited, either after generation or as a prompt when adding a new creature.

3.Clicking the checklist will swap the health display with a list section where text may be added as notes. The image has more detail on its use.

4.Clicking the heart hides the list section, bringing back the health display.

5.Clicking the add creature button again will do so in the next available slot, moving through the rows top to bottom, and the columns from left to right.

6.Clicking the lock button will switch the icon to an open lock, and the backfill of the creature boxes will change. This is to show a new interaction with the boxes.

7.That new interaction will be the ability to click and drag on those boxes to re-arrange them. This will allow for easier organization and grouping of specific creatures, without having to worry about in what order they were added.

8.This image demonstrates the same feature as above.

9.When the unlock button is clicked, it returns to the lock symbol and the backfill of the boxes change. Once again, they will be locked in their positions.
