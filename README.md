# DnD-Creature-Counter
Used to track multiple creatures' stats at a glance in Dungeons and Dragons

The idea is this: a tool which I can use and access as a webpage that gives me multiple input criteria. Things like attacks, the damage of the attack, various modifiers, all that stuff that is necessary to track for certain monsters, with the ability to track multiple of each critter I add. That way, I can easily track multiple creatures at once. Their hit-point values, Armour Class, etc. I'd be able to roll dice for them.

Design Principles/Function that form should follow

1. It should make tracking the status of many monsters easier and more convenient
2. It should be a supplement to other programs which let me track stat blocks, not a replacement
3. It should be easy to glance at, and be beautiful

Things I want to be able to do:
    1. Track Multiple Creatures
        For each creature:
            1. Hitpoints
                - Healthbars/Damage Bars/Options for both!
                - Add/subtract features
            2. Armour Class
            3. Any applied buffs/debuffs/concentration
    2. Add/remove creatures quickly
        - Duplicate an existing creature
        - Create trackers for new creatures, quickly
    3. Track conditions/buffs/debuffs applied to individual creatures
    4. Drag/Drop creature blocks to re-arrange them as I need
